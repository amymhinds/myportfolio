    <p class="brand">I approach programming through the lens of a mathematician. Every project is a series of equations that can 
      be applied to solve the problem both efficiently and precisely.
      I do not shy away from big challenges and have the determination to find solutions, no matter how daunting the task.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p class="text"> I studied math in college, took a break after, and through hiked the 
      Pacific Crest Trail (a backpacking trail from Mexico to Canada).
      After that, I went on to be an actuary for three years in LA. 
      While I was exploring and discovering new foods in the mecca of cuisine, I was also able to explore and 
      discover what I actually liked to do. Part of my job was to take big data sets and use
      SQL/SAS to merge, manipulate and apply modifications to that data. I found that I lost track of time
      challenging myself to come up with the most efficienct solutions to perform 
      my work. After realizing I was probably in the wrong field, I signed up for General Assembly's 
      Software Engineering Immersive Program and started the rest of my journey.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Actuarial Analyst/Senior Catastrophe Modeler at Farmers Insurance</h3>
    <h5>Los Angeles, CA (Mar 2016 - Jan 2019)</h5>
    <p>Pull data and create exhibits from large data sets to model catastrophes and extract losses as well as apply reinsurance and internal adjustments using SQL and SAS.
    Extensive work with large data sets and use of SQL, SAS, and Excel every day. </p>
    <h5>Favorite Project - helped launch Florida's new line of insurance</h5>
    <p>When our company decided to expand and make hurricane coverage available for home insurance 
    policies in Florida, I put together a portfolio of mock policies and predicted what losses
    would be like in that area. I worked with the Pricing Actuarial team to come up with how to price 
    those new policies. </p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>This project is similar to Yelp. It allows a user to login or sign up, and based on 
          their city and cuisine, search for restaurants using the third party Zomato API. The user 
          can then write a review for a restaurant they have been to, and also look at other restaurants
          other users have been to. They can delete reviews as well.
